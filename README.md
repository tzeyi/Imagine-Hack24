## Vsee
Vsee is a website designed to connect startups and venture capitalists with a modern twist. The main idea is to have chatbots act as a 'persona' or 'representative' of a company to chat with other company's chatbots. Upon signing up, users can select whether they are a startup or a venture capitalist. Inspired by dating apps' highly efficient matchmaking UI, users can swipe through a selection of cards detailing each company's information (such as their details, investment amount, and a point system tracking how much information has been fed to their chatbot), while allowing them to submit questions. Additionally, users have a conversational-style interface to answer pre-determined questions and direct questions from venture captialists or start ups to feed data to their chatbot.
